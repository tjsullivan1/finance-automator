# Importer 

These functions will allow importing data from different sources and convert it into our expected data format:

{
    Date: MM/DD/YYYY
    Amount: Dollar Figures
    Description: Text Description from Bank / Financial Statements
}

The goal will be to parse these and add automatic categories where possible. Where not possible, we will flag for follow up.
